## Adding modules to the registry

Adding modules to goget is very easy. You can add a module by editing the file: [/modules/modules.go](https://github.com/MarvinJWendt/goget/blob/main/modules/modules.go).

**Note:** Please make sure to use the latest version. If the module is over v0 or v1 you have to add the latest major version as a suffix, eg. `github.com/auhtor/repo/v2` / `github.com/auhtor/repo/v3`, etc.

As soon as the PR is merged, the module will be accessible to all users.
